## 

This repository is my submission for Peer-graded Assignment in
Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project. 

The repository contains following documents:

* `CodeBook.md` document which describes all variables and data in the script `run_analysis.R` as well as transformations and work that I performed to clean up the data
* `run_analysis.R` … the script performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course project’s definition:
   1. merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
   2. extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
   3. uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
   4. appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names 
   5. from the data set in step 4., creates a second, independent tidy data set with the
average of each variable for each activity and each subject
* `FinalData.txt` … a final tidy data set file &
* `README.md` file
